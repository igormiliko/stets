# STETS - Style Engine in Type Script | Or from german language to english language, Always! ü™Ñ

By inspiration in te week eight of the CS50x course, will be created a all in one framework to build front-end applications based in TypeScript. Yeah, just it!  
The principals points are:  
1. To use just TypeScript, an exception is the index.html :), without a bunch of html and css files. It's disruptive!  
2. Build a component engine based in OOP principles to make the components;  
3. Build a responsive engine to break points;  
4. Make an adaptative, simple and customized front-end framework to use with UML diagrams;  
5. Continuous building.  
After the principals points the organized of the project is the next:  
* A Virtual DOM like a singleton to abstract the DOM interface t the client;  
* A style engine wich can wrap a component to apply styles in a currying techinic;  
* A component factory wich return a fresh component, with an id and a tag of your choice;  
* A component class that abstract a component and extends the Style engine;  
* A breakpoint engine that change the breakpoints;  

The project use the vite development enviroment to help the client to build an application. All files are visible to wich the client can custom the classes and change what he need.  That's the beta version, and the framework started your build. https://vitejs.dev/

## To use:  
1. Just clone in your local machine;
2. Install the dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn`;
3. Configure the color pallete in `@src/Style/config`
4. Always free your creativity;
